View the live project here: https://wyne-ybanez.github.io/personal-portfolio-master/

## Project Goal

This project aims to portray a junior software developer in the best light personally, technically and professionally. It should show the personality of the person, what skills and experience they have obtained throughout their journey as a developer. The project ultimately intends to pitch the junior developer as an asset to hiring businesses/companies. 

Hence the target audience for this project are recruiters (mainly) and users who wish to collaborate with the candidate.

## Disclaimer

For the purpose of this project, the content used to portray the candidate's potential will be fictional.

  <br>
  b. I would like to see if the candidate has completed any coding experience with other businesses.
  <br>

## Design

### Colour Scheme 
- The overall project will use the colors turquoise, sky-blue, dark gray and white. 
- The two main contrasting colours for the project are turquoise and blue. This will be complimented with dark and white background/texts.

### Fonts 
- Montserrat is the font used for the body, it looks clean and professional.
- Roboto is the secondary font - used mainly for headings.
- Sans serif is the fallback font should the fonts be imported incorrectly.

## Wireframes

### Opening the website: 

- The website should be consistent and objective. It should avoid straying away from promoting the candidate, this may create confusion. 

[Screenshot](assets/readMe/hero-sc.png)

### About Me:

- This section of the page will have a call to action buttons, mainly to project.html and contactme.html. 
  
- Should at any point the user feels that they would like to see my projects or contact me. This shortcut shall be provided.

### Transparent Sticky-Navbar: 

- If at any point the user should find themselves lost whilst navigating the website, they should be able to return to the home page or to the page they would like to view easily. 

- Users should be able to traverse to any section of the website at any point in time.

### Contact Form: 

- It would be efficient if there was a way for users to contact the candidate at any point of whilst traversing their website. There is a button 'contact me' on the navigation bar to help with this.
- This feature will require the user to input their contact details via a contact form. 
- Name and the email address is required. 
- If the candidate should ever respond, he/she will then know where/who the response is going to. 

[Screenshot](assets/readMe/contactme-sc.png)

### Projects: 
  
- It will display 4 projects. The projects will for the mean time link to external third-party websites however, in future I will link my other completed projects to this section.

- It will consist of 4 projects supported by descriptive text at the side.

### Footer:
  
- When reaching the end point of the website, there may be a further queries users would like to ask the candidate.
  
- Perhaps the user would like to read back over to the previous content. 
  
- The footer should have the relevant social links and navigation links. These can help users/recruiters to research candidate further or go back over specific content.

## Features

### Responsive: 

  The website should be responsive and confirm all interactions. 

  There should be some sort of indicator or animation that can confirm whenever the user is hovering over a button or clicking on it when using a computer or desktop.

  It should shrink windows and align items correctly when the user is minimizing the window or using a mobile phone. The website should be responsive when viewed on modern devices.

  The website should function accordingly in modern web browsers.

### Interactive: 

  The user should be able to interact with the website and function according to the given text
  i.e. Clicking on 'Contact Me' should bring the user to 'contact.html'.

  Fade animations should be present on accordingly as the user scrolls down.
  
### Convenience: 

  The user should be able to navigate the website at any point in time.
  
  The content of the website should stay relevant and appropriate. 

  The buttons leading to separate pages should appear in good time in preparation for the user's desire to know more about the candidate.

  The content should be clear and presented without any distractions. Ideally the user should know where and what part of the website they are reading/exploring.

You can fork the repository through the following steps. Forking the repository means you will have a copy of the repository and any changes you make will not affect the original repository.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository. Here is a link for the [repository](https://github.com/wyne-ybanez/personal-portfolio-master)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu. Looking towards the right of the page. Locate the button "Fork" then click 
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

### Local Clone

1. Should you wish to use a different IDE like VSCode. You first log in to Github and locate the required repository. Here is the link for this [repository](https://github.com/wyne-ybanez/personal-portfolio-master)
2. Open a new terminal on Git Bash
3. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied 

```

### Known Bugs

(i) There is a bug with the carousel indicator `.carousel-indicators li` by which the indicators move up and down when the testimonial section is viewed on mobile device (iPhone 6, 7, 8).

(ii) When viewed on the Macbook Air 2015 - 13", there was a bug where the blue border behind the "About me" image was not styled properly. The `height` and the `bottom` position the blue box did not apply the styles specified in style.css. However, upon viewing it on the Macbook Pro - 13" and testing on [ami responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#), the border was followed its styling accordingly. 

### Design Changes 

- The website used to incorporate a black background, this has been changed to a white background. Text colors and section backgrounds have been changed accordingly

- Previously, the website would link externally to projects.html and contactme.html. These files have been deleted and instead the site incorporates a one page regiment.

- Previously, it was planned that the Footer would have 3 navigation buttons as specified in the Wireframes. This has been altered and now the footer will now contain navigation links, social icons as well as contact information.

### Future Implementations 

- I would like to style further media queries for the website
- To update the projects.html with real projects
- To update the content to show real work experience
- To add a download cv button in the options menu or the footer
- To code additional Javascript animations on the website in future
- I would like for the contactme.html to send any contacts to my professional email address
