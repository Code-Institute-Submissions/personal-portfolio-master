## Project Goal

This project aims to portray a junior software developer in the best light personally, technically and professionally. It should show the personality of the person, what skills and experience they have obtained throughtout their journey as a developer. The project ultimately intends to pitch the junior developer as an asset to hiring businesses/companies. 

Hence the target audience for this project are recruiters (mainly) and curious users.

## Design

### Colour Scheme 
- The overall project will have a black background.
- The two main contrasting colours for the project is blue green and blue with white texts.

### Fonts 
- Montserrat is the font used for the body, it looks clean and professional.
- Roboto is the secondary font - used mainly for headings.
- Sans serif is the fallback font should the fonts be imported incorrectly.

### Separated pages 
- Separate pages such as contactme.html and projects.html will have a background with a dark linear gradiet. This avoids distraction.
- Making it darker like index.html but also having a unique image in the back to make the page interesting rather than have it all black.

## Wireframes

### Opening the website: 

- The website should be consistent and objective. It should avoid straying away from promoting the candidate, this may create confusion.

### About Me:

- This section of the page will have a call to action buttons, mainly to project.html and contactme.html.

### Transparent Sticky-Navbar: 

- If at any point the user should find themselves lost whilst navigating the website, they should be able to return to the home page or to the page they would like to view easily. 

- Users should be able to traverse to any section of the website at any point in time.

### Contact Form: 

- It would be efficient if there was a way for users to contact the candidate at any point of whilst traversing their website. There is a button placed on the navbar to help with this.
- This feature will require the user to input their contact details via a contact form. 
- Name and the email address is required. 
- If the candidate should ever respond, he/she will then know where/who the response is going to. 

[Screenshot](assets/readMe/contactme-sc.png)

### Projects: 
  
- It will display 4 projects. The projects will for the mean time link to external third-party websites however, in future I will link my other completed projects to this section.

- It will consist of 4 projects supported by descriptive text at the side.

### Footer:

- 3 buttons, to return to the top of the page, to check candidates projects, to contact the candidate.
  
- When reaching the end point of the website, there may be a further queries users would like to ask the candidate or know more about. 
  
- The 'contact me' and 'projects' buttons are present in preparation for this.

- The footer should have the relevant social links and buttons. These can help users/recruiters to research candidate further.

## Features

### Responsive: 

  The website should be responsive and confirm all interactions. 

  There should be some sort of indicator or animation that can confirm whenever the user is hovering over a button or clicking on it when using a computer or desktop.

  It should shrink it's windows and align items correctly when the user is minimzing the window or using a mobile phone. The website should be responsive when viewed on modern devices.

  The website should function accordingly in modern web browsers.

 

### Interactive: 

  The user should be able to interact with the website and function according to the given text
  i.e. Clicking on 'Contact Me' should bring the user to 'contact.html'.

  Fade animations should be present on accordingly as the user scrolls down.
  
### Convenience: 

  The user should be able to navigate the website at any point in time.
  
  The content of the website should stay relevant and appropriate. 

  The buttons leading to separate pages should appear in good time in preparation for the user's desire to know more about the candidate.

  The content should be clear and presented without any distractions. Ideally the user should know where and what part of the website they are reading/exploring.
