# Code Institute Personal Portfolio Project

## Project Goal

This project aims to portray a junior software developer in the best light personally, technically and professionally. It should show the personality of the person, what skills and experience they have obtained throughtout their professional life as a developer. The project ultimately intends to pitch the junior developer as an asset to hiring businesses/companies. 

## UX 

The website should allow it's users to automatically identify the reason for why the website was created. In this case, the website is created to appeal to users,recruiters and hiring managers.

- As a recruiter I will have had worked through many resumes in order to find the right candidate. I would want a resume or website resume that can catch my attention from the get and maintain it. 
  
- As a user I would appreciate a website that would be easy to navigate. 

- As a user I would also prefer if the website can communicate the reasoning for its creation from the first instance of perceiving it.

Opening the website:

- The website should be consistent and objective. It should avoid straying away from promoting the candidate, this may create confusion. 

- The website must must navigate to relevant information, either by scrolling up and down or using the navigation links in the navbar. 
  
-  If I as a user or recruiter would like to know about the candidate i.e. their personality/ their experience and skills. This should be on the website & I should be able to find this quickly and easily.

Transparent Fixed-Navbar: 

- If at any point I should find myself lost whilst navigating the website, I should be able to return to the home page or to the page I would like to view easily. 

- I should be able to traverse to any section of the website at any point in time.

- At no point should the navbar distract me from the information provided on the candidate's websit. Hence, it should be transparent.

Footer:

- When reaching the end point of the website, there may be a further queries I would like to ask the candidate. I would appreciate it if there was a way to contact the candidate.

- The footer should have the relevant social links and buttons. These can help me as a user/recruiter to research candidate further to discover more about them. 

- If I would like to read back over information in the previous sections. The footer should allow me to return to the relevant pages ie. Home page.

Testimonials: 

- Perhaps I would like to know more about the candidate, about impressions past employers or connections hold towards him/her.

- Should I find myself in this page, it is probably because I require social proof. I am looking for a candidate that can be of benefit to us now and in future.

- I would like to investigate further if this candidate is great match for our organization. I want to know the projects he/she has collaborated with, what he/she is doing now and what he/she hopes to be.

Responsive: 

- The website should be responsive and confirm all interactions. 

- There should be some sort of indicator or animation that can confirm whenever I am hovering over a button or clicking on it when using a computer or desktop.

- It should shrink it's windows and align items correctly when I am minimzing the window or using a mobile phone.
