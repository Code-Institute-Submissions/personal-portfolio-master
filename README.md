# Code Institute MS1: Personal Portfolio Project

[View the live project here.](https://wyne-ybanez.github.io/personal-portfolio-master/)

## Project Goal

This project aims to portray a junior software developer in the best light personally, technically and professionally. It should show the personality of the person, what skills and experience they have obtained throughtout their professional life as a developer. The project ultimately intends to pitch the junior developer as an asset to hiring businesses/companies. 

For the purpose of this project, the content used to portray the candidate's potential will be fictional. 

## UX 

- ### User Stories:

- ### First Time Visitor Goals:

  1. I would like to know the purpose for the creation of the website from the first instance of opening it.
  2. I would greatly appreciate it if the website were easy to navigate.
  3. I expect the website to display relevant content and stay consistently relevant as I explore the site.
  4. I would appreciate it if my interactions with the site were acknowledged so that I know what I am doing and where I am going. 
  5. I would like the content to be structured and easy to follow.
  
- ### Returning Visitor Goals:
  
  1. I would like to see in-depth information to the website with regards to how the candidate is improving in his ability to code. 
  2. I would like to see if the candidate has completed any coding experience with other businesses.
  3. I would like to it if there were a way to contact the candidate and find out more information.

- ### Frequent Visitor Goals: 
  
  1. I would like to check if the candidate is working on any projects.
  2. I want to be able to contact the candidate quickly.
  3. I want to be able to navigate to any section of the website in order to read it in more detail.

## Design

### Colour Scheme 
- The overall projec will have a black background.
- The two main contrasting colours for the project is blue green and blue with white texts.

### Fonts 
- Montserrat is the font used for the body, it looks clean and professional.
- Roboto is the secondary font - used mainly for headings.
- Sans serif is the fallback font should the fonts be imported incorrectly.

### Separated pages 
- Separate pages such as contactme.html and projects.html will have a background with a dark linear gradiet. This avoids distraction.
- Making it darker like index.html but also having a unique image in the back to make the page interesting rather than have it all black.
  

### Opening the website:

- The website should be consistent and objective. It should avoid straying away from promoting the candidate, this may create confusion.

- Users should be able to traverse to any section of the website at any point in time.

### Contact Form: 

[Click here - Contact Me Wireframe](assets/readMe/contact-me.png)

- It would be efficient if there was a way for users to contact the candidate at any point of whilst traversing their website. There is a button placed on the navbar to help with this.
- This feature will require the user to input their contact details via a contact form. 
- Name and the email address is required. 
- If the candidate should ever respond, he/she will then know where/who the response is going to.
